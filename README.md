This assignment lets you practice RMI in Java and includes concepts such as Networking, RMI, and Serialization.

<em>Give a solution to the following problem (RMI System for car registration): </em>

A Car object is described by model, color, mileage, and plate. All the values are given, except plate which is undefined.

The plate value is calculated by the RMI server. The server algorithm for calculating the car plate is simple: the server invokes <em>hashCode()</em> for the Car object.

The client must print Car object and send it to the server for car registration. Once the car is registered, the client must print the Car object again, this time with its assigned plate number.

<em>Hints: You can assume that the client and server run on the local machine.</em>

<strong> </strong><strong>Marking Criteria and Tasks:</strong>

Please note that you should:

a- have appropriate indentation. b- have proper file structures and modularization. c- follow Java naming conventions. d- document all the classes properly. e- not have debug/useless code and/or file(s) left in assignment.

f- have good intra and/or inter class designs.

in your code!
